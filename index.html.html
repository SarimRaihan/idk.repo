                  Hi there!
                  glad you entered my webpage :)
                  I know the webpage looks pale as hell.
                  Moreover Ths is my first time creating a webpage.so,not yet an expert at designing it
                  The main purpose I created it is for making a paragraph introducing myself and giving a bit of a
                  life story of mine:D
                  So here I go:

                  Name's Sarim Raihan, grade 6, 14 yo old ,an introvert, reads in BES. (Bangladesh Elementary School)
                  Born in Saudia Arabia(Lived 8 yrs there) had the best and wholesome times and memories.
                  Now lives in Bangladesh (living here for almost 6 yrs now) which is going pretty decent,like "not too 
                  craggy-not too lavish" life.Likes to play games and listening to music.Talking about music, favourite generas
                  would be hip-hop and R&Bs and some fav artists are The Weknd,Jordan Majid,Kendrick Lamar, Sly3r.
                  Hobby is to inhale oxygen,been doing this my whole life and I love it!
                   
                  

                  
                  The first school I was admissionated to was Shuru International Indian School
                  known as the embassy of Indian school which is in Saudia, Makkah.
                  Noticed it mentioned 'Indian' but that doesen't means all students were Indians.
                  Some of them were from other countries of South Asia as well.
                  And if I had to guess from my prespective,
                  there were about 60% Indians, 40% pakistanis and 10% bangladeshis .
                  (I am included in 10%) and other foreign students as well, 
                  Studied there starting from K.G to grade 2 .
                  Had friends which was cool, forgot most of their names :/
                  Still remebered one though.Think his name was Mohmmad. Would share whenever needed,
                  doesen't talks frequently(like me lol) still awesome.
                  The principal of the SIIS and the teachers were really impressed of my english accent despite the fact 
                  I flunked alot in exams.But,was good in maths though.
                  
                  

                                                             
                                                               
                                                                
                                                               
                                                            
                  
                                    


                  
                  Had good friends,english accent was waayy better,had the greatest days :)
